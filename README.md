# Intro

I am using this repository to learn the various Proxy tools (ZAP, Caido, Burp Suite) and how to create manual POCs for vulnerabilities while walking through the PortSwigger WebSecurity Academy material. 

## Breakdown

Each learning path/concept will be grouped into its own folder containing additional subdirectories for each lab found within the learning path or general topic.

### Example Structure
- Root Folder
    - Authentication Labs
        - Lab_1
            - script.py
        - Lab_2
            - script.py
        - And so on...

## Feedback
If you have any feedback, definitely let me know!
